I wanted to learn a bit about web components and so here I go! [MDN web component docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) was my guide to get started.

### Develop

#### Run  Client

- Spin up an `yarn start` from within the `/client`  directory and head to `localhost:8080`.

#### Run Server

- `yarn start` from within the `/server` directory
